# Meta-Analysis with R Workshop

### Wolfgang Viechtbauer

#### February 21 and May 6, 2022

## Overview

This repo contains the materials for the "Meta-Analysis with R" workshop given on February 21 (with a follow-up meeting on May 6), 2022, as part of the [2022 Evidence Synthesis & Meta-Analysis in R Conference](https://www.eshackathon.org/events/2022-01-ESMARConf2022.html). Further details about the workshop can be found [here](https://www.wvbauer.com/doku.php/workshop_ma_esmarconf).

Note that I ended up not covering even half of what I had planned for the day. So, I will do a follow-up session and the materials here will be updated later. See https://www.wvbauer.com/doku.php/live_streams for information on the future stream / session.
